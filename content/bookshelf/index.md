Leave me alone with a book and the concept of time goes into a state of non-existence for me.

I enjoy reading books on anything and everything. Some of my favorite subjects are

- Finance and Investments
- Business
- History
- Technology (Mostly computers and programming)
- Biographies (Technically not a subject)
- Classics
