Title: Dark Emu

Author: Bruce Pascoe

My rating: ★★★

### Key points

Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.
