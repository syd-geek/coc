I came across the concept of [Positive Asymmetry](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-6-2022/) and it got me thinking about few things.

According to Shane

> Linear games are won by working harder than others. And the harder other people work, the higher the bar.

What is happening here is that you are competing with others so that you remain at least up to their level. The alternative would be to remain on a level below them.

This has many problems. The first one is that the hard work is being done because someone else is working harder. Second is that you are looking at your achievements through the lens of others.

By following this approach, you may achieve plenty. A big house, luxury car, holidays and other status symbols. But to maintain them, the treadmill has to keep running and you have to be on it. What's more painful is that the speed at which you are running must keep increasing.

This way of going through life suits someone who is driven by outer scorecard.

There may be an upside to this, but that too depends on external validation.

A better way is to cultivate Positive Asymmetry. Shane describes it as

> Positive asymmetry happens when you have a lot of upside and little downside

A job for example is a linear game. Your income depends on your skills and how hard can you work for someone else.

Positive Asymmetry is the independence which you can have by pursuing financial independence.

It is not hard to understand.

Working for someone else (a company) may appear to have lot of upside and it may even exist during early years of working life, but the downside is that you can loose the job and may have to start from a lower level to get to where you were.

Working for yourself or deriving your income through investments has more upside. You are not answerable to anyone. You have time to pursue your interests and unless you make stupid decision driven by greed, your life can be more fulfilling.

Remember, no one on their deathbed wished that they had spent more time at work.
