In my home office I have a decent bookshelf and looking at it gives me a feeling of joy. Today, I decided to re-organize it a bit. Nothing too methodical but just shuffling few books here and there.

My method of organizing books is no method at all. If someone looked at it then he/she will think that there is no system and it is complete chaos. So how does one find a book where there is no system to how they are placed? I guess if you admire them the way I do then finding any book is easy. Maybe there is a system here which my brain has created but forgot to inform me.
