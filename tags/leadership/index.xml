Author: Conn Iggulden
My rating: ★★★
I got interested in Mongolian history and Genghis Khan after watching a brilliant series called Marco Polo on Netflix. After watching the series, I wanted to know more about Genghis Khan who was the founder of one of the greatest empires ever. I also wanted to be entertained so I picked up the historical fiction Conqueror series written by Conn Iggulden.</description></item></channel></rss>
