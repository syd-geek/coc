Author: Conn Iggulden
My rating: ★★★
I got interested in Mongolian history and Genghis Khan after watching a brilliant series called Marco Polo on Netflix. After watching the series, I wanted to know more about Genghis Khan who was the founder of one of the greatest empires ever. I also wanted to be entertained so I picked up the historical fiction Conqueror series written by Conn Iggulden.</description></item><item><title>Dark Emu</title><link>/posts/dark-emu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-emu/</guid><description>Title: Dark Emu
Author: Bruce Pascoe
My rating: ★★★
Key points Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.</description></item></channel></rss>
