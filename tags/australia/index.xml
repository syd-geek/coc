Author: Bruce Pascoe
My rating: ★★★
Key points Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.</description></item></channel></rss>
