[{"categories":["Life"],"content":"I came across the concept of Positive Asymmetry and it got me thinking about few things.\nAccording to Shane\n Linear games are won by working harder than others. And the harder other people work, the higher the bar.\n What is happening here is that you are competing with others so that you remain at least up to their level. The alternative would be to remain on a level below them.\nThis has many problems. The first one is that the hard work is being done because someone else is working harder. Second is that you are looking at your achievements through the lens of others.\nBy following this approach, you may achieve plenty. A big house, luxury car, holidays and other status symbols. But to maintain them, the treadmill has to keep running and you have to be on it. What\u0026rsquo;s more painful is that the speed at which you are running must keep increasing.\nThis way of going through life suits someone who is driven by outer scorecard.\nThere may be an upside to this, but that too depends on external validation.\nA better tool is to cultivate Positive Asymmetry. Shane describes it as\n Positive asymmetry happens when you have a lot of upside and little downside\n A job for example is a linear game. Your income depends on your skills and how hard can you work for someone else.\nPositive Asymmetry is the independence which you can have by pursuing financial independence.\nIt is not hard to understand.\nWorking for someone else (a company) may appear to have lot of upside and it may even exist during early years of working life, but the downside is that you can loose the job and may have to start from a lower level to get to where you were.\nWorking for yourself or deriving your income through investments has more upside. You are not answerable to anyone. You have time to pursue your interests and unless you make stupid decision driven by greed, your life can be more fulfilling.\nRemember, no one on their deathbed wished that they had spent more time at work.\n","date":"Mar 7, 2022","img":"","permalink":"/posts/understanding-asymmetry/","series":null,"tags":[],"title":"Linear Effort Is Not the Way"},{"categories":null,"content":"Leave me alone with a book and the concept of time goes into a state of non-existence for me.\nI enjoy reading books on anything and everything.

After watching the series, I wanted to know more about Genghis Khan who was the founder of one of the greatest empires ever. I also wanted to be entertained so I picked up the historical fiction Conqueror series written by Conn Iggulden. This are my reflections on the first book in the series titled Wolf of the Plains.\nIn the beginning was a tribe commanded by a powerful figure who seemed to have everything under control. Everything was going well until the turn of events which changed everything for the tribe and the leader’s family. A family found itself in the most difficult circumstances with one singular goal which was to survive.\nA young boy after going through the severe hardship ended up in situations where he almost died. Gradually the ruthlessness became a dominating trait and the desire to avenge became the goal of his life. After destroying the enemies, he set out to do something far bigger than just revenge. He set his eyes on ruling all the known land. And he did.\nI found the book so interesting that I found it hard to put down. While reading, I also came across a bunch of mental models.\n Overconfidence (by the people against whom Temujin took his revenge) Collaboration Change  There are five books in the series and I’m looking forward to reading them all.\nHappy reading.\n","date":"Dec 11, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/wolf-of-the-plains/","series":null,"tags":["Genghis Khan","History","Leadership","Mongolia"],"title":"Wolf of the Plains"},{"categories":["Books"],"content":"Title: Dark Emu\nAuthor: Bruce Pascoe\nMy rating: ★★★\nKey points Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.\n","date":"Nov 26, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/dark-emu/","series":null,"tags":["Australia","History"],"title":"Dark Emu"},{"categories":null,"content":" A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step – Chinese proverb   This is the first step.\n","date":"Nov 18, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/first-step/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"First Step"},{"categories":null,"content":"I try to figure out what many others have mastered.\nBy following this approach, I am no longer the person I was and I can say with conviction that I won’t be what I am in the future.\nI have been working on self improvement for more than twenty years and I\u0026rsquo;m thankful that I started this journey.\n","date":"Feb 28, 2019","img":"","permalink":"/about/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"content":"","date":"Feb 28, 2019","img":"","permalink":"/sites-i-like/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Sites I Like"},{"categories":null,"content":"","date":"Jan 1, 0001","img":"","permalink":"/contact/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Contact"},{"categories":null,"content":"","date":"Jan 1, 0001","img":"","permalink":"/offline/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Offline"}]
