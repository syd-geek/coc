According to Shane
Linear games are won by working harder than others. And the harder other people work, the higher the bar.
What is happening here is that you are competing with others so that you remain at least up to their level. The alternative would be to remain on a level below them.</description></item><item><title>Wolf of the Plains</title><link>/posts/wolf-of-the-plains/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wolf-of-the-plains/</guid><description>Title: Wolf of the Plains
Author: Conn Iggulden
My rating: ★★★
I got interested in Mongolian history and Genghis Khan after watching a brilliant series called Marco Polo on Netflix. After watching the series, I wanted to know more about Genghis Khan who was the founder of one of the greatest empires ever. I also wanted to be entertained so I picked up the historical fiction Conqueror series written by Conn Iggulden.</description></item><item><title>Dark Emu</title><link>/posts/dark-emu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-emu/</guid><description>Title: Dark Emu
Author: Bruce Pascoe
My rating: ★★★
Key points Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.</description></item><item><title>First Step</title><link>/posts/first-step/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 21:03:44 +1100</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-step/</guid><description>A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step – Chinese proverb This is the first step.</description></item></channel></rss>
